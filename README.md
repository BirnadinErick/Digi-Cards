# Django-Flashcards
A Django app to digitalize the **flashcards**

## How to setup
* This django app needs the following
  * python 3.5+
  * djnago 3+
  * django-ckeditor-5
* Just like a normal django app run it

## Database
Django-Flashcards uses MySQL(MariaDB) as its main database.

## Models
**models.py** inside the main application contains the schema for all the models.
There are 5 models each corresponding to:-
  * Subject
  * Unit
  * Sub Unit
  * Flashcard
  
## I hope this will help someone one way or the another. 😉
